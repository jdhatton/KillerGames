There are 6 directories and one file

                     Sequential, Threaded, and NIO directories.

Firewalls:	contains examples related to communication through 
		firewalls.

Multicast:	a 'client' and 'server' which use UDP multicasting

NIO:		a TCP server that uses nonblocking sockets

Sequential:	a sequential TCP server (processes one client at a time)

Threaded:	a threaded TCP server (can process many clients at a time)

UDP:		a client and server using UDP 


The client and server examples are set up to run on the same machine
(i.e. the server's address is localhost).
