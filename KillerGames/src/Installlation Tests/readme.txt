============================
This directory contains two installers:

*  bugRun.instal4j        // creates an installer for the BugRunner example
*  checkers3D.install4j   // creates an installer for the Checkers3D example

These are install4j files; install4j is available from
http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html

I used the evaluation copy of install4j Enterprise Edition, v.2.0.7


Note. The .install4j files assume that this directory 
("Installation Tests") is on the Windows desktop (i.e.
at c:\Windows\Desktop).

If you locate this directory somewhere else, you'll need to
double check the file paths used in the .install4j files.


The other files in this directory are splash screens and 
icons used by the installers.

There are three subdirectories:
     BugRunner/        // contains the BugRunner code
     Checkers3D/       // contains the Checkers3D code
     Uninstall Code/   // the code for the uninstaller actions

Please look at the readme files in those directories.
