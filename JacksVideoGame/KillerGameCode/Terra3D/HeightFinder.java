/* HeightFinder was designed to hide the slowness of picking
   for such a large object (the mesh loaded from the landscape's 
   OBJ file).

   Picking is carried out by getLandHeight(), applied to the 
   landBG BranchGroup. getLandHeight() may take 1-2 seconds to
   complete.

   KeyBehaviour interacts with HeightFinder by calling 
   requestMoveHeight() which stores a (x,y,z) coordinate in theMove. 
   The y-value is a dummy, but the
   (x,z) pair will be used by getLandHeight() to get the y-height at 
   that point.

   requestMoveHeight() returns immediately; KeyBehavior does not wait
   for an answer, or it would be waiting for 1-2 seconds, maybe more.
   Instead, KeyBehavior simply uses the current y-height for its move.

   HeightFinder's run() method constantly loops: it reads the current
   move request from theMove, then calls getLandHeight(). At the end
   of getLandHeight(), the new height is passed back to KeyBehavior by
   calling its adjustHeight() method.

   This approach decouples KeyBehavior from the slow picking operation.
   The downside is that KeyBehavior will use an out-of-date height
   until told a new height by HeightFinder.

   KeyBehavior may send many move requests to HeightFinder while 
   getLandHeight() is slowly churing away, which is fine. When 
   getLandHeight() returns, run() will get the most recent request 
   from theMove and start picking again.

   This approach means that KeyBehavior can deal with very fast user
   keypresses, even though picking is slow.
