Notes

The preface, and chapters 1, 5, and 14 don't have any zipped code.

The code for chapters 3 and 4 are zipped together in chs3and4Code.zip
since they're variants of the same 'worm' example.

The code for chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 are zipped together in
chs7to10Code.zip since they're all about sound.


---------------------------------
Code that Isn't Here

This directory can be found as a single zip file at:
http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/code/

Also on that page are four files **NOT** in this directory:

1. NCSA Portfolio (JAR file) (458 KB).
   Used in chapters 16, 18, 19, 24, 27, and 32.
   Portfolio is a very useful collection of model loaders.
   Available as http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/code/portfolio.jar

2. Daniel Selman's Java3dTree package (JAR file) (73 KB).
   This package is part of the source code downloadable from 
   http://www.manning.com/selman/ for Selman's excellent Java 3D 
   Programming textbook.
   Used in chapter 15.
   Available as http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/code/j3dtree.jar

3. Two zipped OBJ files used for the landscapes in chapter 27
       test1.obj (1.05MB), test2.obj (1.05MB). 
   Available as http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/code/test1obj.zip
            and http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/code/test2obj.zip

---------------------------------
Getting this Code to Work (Part 1)

I sometimes get queries about this code "not compiling" or "not working".
It does compile and work, _but_ you need to have installed Java and
Java 3D first. 

Java 3D is not part of the standard Java distribution; it's a separate
download. Install Java first, then Java 3D.

1. Java
Install either
   J2SE 5.0	http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp
or J2SE 1.4.2   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html

The examples work with both versions.


2. Java 3D
Java 3D is used extensively in this book -- it's the basis of all the 
3D examples (15 chapters worth), two of the networking chapters, and 
it's accurate timer class is used in six of the 2D chapters 
(chapters 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, and 13). There are alternatives to using the 
Java 3D timer, which I discuss in chapter 2.

Install either
   Java 3D 1.3.1   http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/download.html
   (go for the OpenGL version if you're not sure)

or Java 3D 1.3.2  https://java3d.dev.java.net/
   (go for the latest release).

The examples work with both 1.3.1 and 1.3.2.

There is a Java 3D 1.4, but that's in development as I write this.

Details on how to test Java 3D _before_ you try out my code can be found 
in chapter 14. 

---------------------------------
Getting this Code to Work (Part 2)

Each of the code directories contains its own readme.txt file which
details how to compile and execute that chapter's examples.

[book PIC]Code for Killer Game Programming in Java

 
This page contains links to all the code used in the book.

You can download almost all the code as a single zip file, kgpjCode.zip (3.06 MB). kgpjCode.zip contains multiple zip files, one for each chapter of the book.

Alternatively, you can download the code on a chapter-by-chapter basis by going to the relevant chapter page via the top-level page of this site.

Files not in kgpjCode.zip

kgpjCode.zip doesn't actually contain all the code; it's missing four files which can be downloaded from here (or from the relevant chapter Web page):

NCSA Portfolio (zipped) (402 KB)
Portfolio is a very useful collection of model loaders. Used in chapters 16, 18, 19, 24, 27, and 32.
It was developed by the now-defunct NCSA Java 3D Group, in a project led by Steve Pietrowicz and Chris Heistad. 
 
Daniel Selman's Java3dTree package (JAR file) (73 KB).
This package is part of the source code downloadable from http://www.manning.com/selman/ for Selman's excellent Java 3D Programming textbook. Used in chapter 15.
 
Two zipped OBJ files used for the landscapes in chapter 27:
test1.obj (1.05MB), test2.obj (1.05MB).

Java. Install the latest version of Java.
The examples are known to work with all versions since J2SE 1.4.2.

The examples are known to work with all versions since Java 3D 1.3.1. 
 
Please test Java 3D before you try out my code.
Download, compile, and execute HelloUniverse (2 KB). If Java 3D is properly installed, then it will show a spinning colored cube. 
HelloUniverse is a simplified version of a standard Java 3D example. 
 
Getting my Code to Work (Part 2)

Each of the code directories contains its own readme.txt file which explains how to compile and execute that chapter's examples.

 
Getting my Code to Work with Linux

Jason Morin, a Linux games programmer, has had case-insensitivity problems when loading some files. For example, chapter 24 uses a 3D model which the code refers to as "Coolrobo.3ds". Unfortunately, the file is actually called "COOLROBO.3DS".

The case difference doesn't matter on Windows, which is why it slipped past me. On Linux, it triggers an error message about the file not being found.

The fix is to change the name of the file so its case matches that used in the code (e.g. rename "COOLROBO.3DS" to "Coolrobo.3ds"). There's no need to modify the Java code.
